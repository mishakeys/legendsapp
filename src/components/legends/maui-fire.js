`Long ago, the people of Hilo had no fire. They ate their food raw — breadfruit, fish, 

and kalo leaves that left their mouths itchy and sore. Without fire, life was hard.

On the southern slopes of Halaʻi Hill, a thin white smoke was often seen rising among the ferns. 

Children and curious villagers would rush to find its source, but all they found were startled 

ʻalae birds fluttering away, leaving behind only ashes and charred sticks.

The people tried everything to discover the secret of fire, but no one could catch the clever ʻalae birds.

Even the great Maui tried and failed. The birds were always alert and never lit their fires when he was near, waiting until he went fishing with his brothers.

One day, Maui and his brothers devised a plan. They placed gourds in their canoe, dressing them to look like men. 

From a distance, it seemed the brothers had set out to sea. Meanwhile, Maui climbed quietly up Halaʻi Hill, 

hiding among the ferns, ready to finally learn the birds' secret. Hidden among the ferns, Maui waited patiently. At last, the ʻalae birds, 

thinking the coast was clear, gathered to make their fire. Maui watched as they struck two dry sticks together, c

ausing smoke to curl up and flames to spark. The secret was revealed: fire came from rubbing sticks.

Just as the fire flared, Maui sprang from his hiding place. The startled birds scattered, but Maui was swift. 

He caught their leader, the clever ʻAlaeʻula, the mud hen with red across its forehead. Holding the bird firmly, 

Maui demanded, "Tell me how you make fire, or I will punish you!"

Terrified, the ʻalaeʻula agreed. "Rub dry sticks together the ʻŌhiʻa and the Hau — and the fire will come," she confessed.

Maui let her go, but before she flew off, he scorched her forehead with a fiery brand, staining it red forever. 

That is why to this day, the ʻalaeʻula, or Hawaiian mud hen, carries a red mark on its head.

Thanks to Maui, the secret of fire was given to the people. From that time on, the people of Hilo were able to cook their food and live more comfortably, 

honoring the clever demigod who outwitted the watchful birds.
