`According to Hawaiian legend, Maui, the powerful young demigod, had a magic canoe and a magic fishhook. 

With his canoe, he could cross the distance from Hawai‘i Island to Maui in just two strokes of his paddle. 

His fishhook was so powerful that he could catch every fish in the sea if he wanted.

One day, while watching another canoe set out for Maui, Maui thought of a way to make life easier for his people. 

He imagined pulling all the Hawaiian Islands together, so travel between them would be faster and safer. 

He called a meeting with the chiefs and strongest men of Hawai‘i Island and shared his plan. 

They would all work together to pull the islands close, but there was one important rule. 

No matter how hard the work was or how long it took, no one could look back until the islands were firmly joined.

Everyone agreed. Maui fastened his magic fishhook into the land at Hāna, the part of Maui Island closest to Hawai‘i Island. At Maui’s command, 

the chiefs and strong men paddled with all their might. Slowly, the island of Maui began to move across the ocean toward Hawai‘i. The men could feel 

the pull and see the distance closing, but they obeyed Maui’s warning and kept their eyes forward.

After a long and tiring effort, the islands were only a few feet apart. The men were excited, but one chief, unable to control his curiosity, 

turned around to see how much progress they had made. In that moment, the magic was broken. Maui Island slipped away and returned to its original place. 

The fishermen and chiefs tried their best to stop it, but it was too late. However, the spot where Maui’s fishhook was stuck remained behind, leaving a small piece of land. 

That small piece of land is what we know today as Coconut Island, or Moku Ola, in Hilo Bay.

In addition to this legend, it is also said that swimming around Coconut Island three times can bring healing and good health.`
