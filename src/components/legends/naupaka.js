`Long ago, in ancient Hawaiʻi, there lived a beautiful princess named Naupaka who made her home in the cool, 

misty mountains. One day, she met Kaui, a fisherman from the sea, and they quickly fell in love. But their love was forbidden, 

as Naupaka was royalty and Kaui was a commoner. The rules of their society kept them apart.

Hoping to find a way to be together, Naupaka and Kaui visited a wise elder, who sadly told them their love was kapu — sacred and forbidden. 

Determined, they traveled a great distance to seek help from a kahuna, a high priest. The kahuna, bound by ancient laws, could not bless their 

union either and urged them to pray directly to the gods.

They prayed with all their hearts, but the gods answered not with a blessing, but with a fierce storm, a sign that their love was not meant to be. 

Heartbroken, Naupaka and Kaui knew they had no choice but to part. As a final act of love, Naupaka picked a flower from her hair, tore it in half, 

and gave one piece to Kaui. She returned to the mountains, and he made his way back to the sea.

From that day, the naupaka flower, once whole, began to bloom only in halves — one kind in the mountains and one kind by the ocean — never together. 

The flowers, each appearing like only one half of a whole, remind all who see them of Naupaka and Kaui’s love and eternal separation. 

It is said that when the two types of naupaka are brought together, the lovers are momentarily reunited, as if time and distance no longer exist between them.`
