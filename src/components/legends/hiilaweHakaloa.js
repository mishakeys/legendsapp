`In the deep, misty valley of Waipiʻo, where the cliffs rise high and the rivers weave like silver threads, there lived a woman named Hiʻilawe. 

She was known for her beauty and kindness, and her heart belonged to a man named Hakalaoa. Their love was strong and quiet, growing in secret among the trees, 

far from the eyes of the world. But their happiness did not go unnoticed. Lono, the powerful god of rain and storms, saw Hiʻilawe and was captivated by her beauty. 

He wished to make her his bride. When Hiʻilawe and Hakalaoa realized they were being pursued by a god, they were afraid. Knowing they could not outrun a divine being, 

they fled deeper into the valley, seeking safety in its hidden folds.

Desperate to stay together, they prayed to the ancient gods for help. Moved by their devotion, the gods answered, not by hiding them, 

but by changing their forms so their love could last forever. Hiʻilawe was transformed into a waterfall, her spirit flowing down the cliffs 

in an endless stream. Hakalaoa became a stone at the base of the falls, unmoving but forever close to her.

The water of Hiʻilawe Falls is said to be her tears, falling through time, always reaching out to touch Hakalaoa below. No matter the seasons or the years, 

the waterfall and the stone remain together, a symbol of love so deep that even the will of gods could not tear them apart.

When visitors stand before Hiʻilawe Falls today, they are standing in the presence of this ancient love — a love that speaks through the mist, the water, 

and the wind, reminding all who come of a bond that even time cannot break.`
