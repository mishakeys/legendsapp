`Desperate for a hiding place, Mo‘o Kuna sank to the bottom of a deep, murky pool. 

Maui, relentless in his pursuit, chased after him, driving his spear from one hiding hole to another, 

diving into several deep pools along the river. 

Finally, he could make out the dark, monstrous form of Mo‘o Kuna beneath the cloudy water.

Maui cried out to the volcano goddess Pele for help. Pele answered, sending a rain of hot stones

which she hurled into the river. The waters boiled furiously, turning the pools into a seething cauldron. Burned and exhausted, 

Mo‘o Kuna struggled to drag himself from the scalding depths, desperate to escape downstream.

The place where this battle raged is known today as the Boiling Pots. These pools still bubble and surge vigorously, 

though time has cooled their waters, serving as a lasting reminder of the time when Mo‘o Kuna sought refuge there.

As Mo‘o Kuna scrambled up the riverbank, Maui hurled his spear one final time, striking the monster and ending his reign of terror. 

The boiling waters carried Mo‘o Kuna’s lifeless body over Rainbow Falls, where it crashed onto the rocks below.

It is said that his body remains there still, forming the long black island known as Kuna. 

The currents of the Wailuku River surge around him, the waters of Rainbow Falls drum on his back, and every storm’s 

rain beats down upon the monster who once dared to threaten the goddess Hina.
