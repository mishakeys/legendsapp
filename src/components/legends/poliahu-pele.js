  `One sunny day, high on the snowy slopes of Mauna Kea, the snow goddess Poliʻahu along with her four maidens.  

  Took their hōlua sleds down to a long racecourse that stretched from the top of the mountain all the way to the sea.

The maidens laughed and cheered as Poliʻahu took the first ride. She jumped onto her sled and raced down the mountainside. 

When she finally stopped, she marked her place and stepped aside. One by one, her maidens followed but none could go as far as Poliʻahu.

As they gathered at the bottom, they noticed a stranger watching them. She was a beautiful woman dressed in a black robe with eyes that glowed like hot coals.

"I would like to race," the woman said, "but I have no sled."

"You may use one of ours," Poliʻahu offered kindly. One of her maidens quickly handed over her sled.

The stranger accepted without even saying thank you.

She climbed up the slope with Poliʻahu, and when they raced, she sped down with great skill. But Poliʻahu still went farther.

“That sled didn’t fit me!” the stranger snapped.

A taller maiden gave her a different sled, and they raced again. Still, Poliʻahu won.

Frustrated, the stranger said, “Let’s go even higher. I always raced a longer course. This time, you go first.”

Poliʻahu agreed and started her run from the top of Mauna Kea. But just as she flew down the slope, the stranger stomped her foot.

BOOM!

The mountain rumbled. A giant crack split open in the earth. Steam poured into the air, blocking the view of the maidens waiting below.

When the steam cleared, they saw lava pouring out of the ground. The stranger's robe turned red like fire. Her eyes burned with fury.

“It’s Pele!” the maidens cried. “The volcano goddess!”

Poliʻahu raced toward the lava. Pele, now standing on her sled, sped after her. The maidens raised their hands and chanted to the snowy mountain, begging for help. Snow began to fall from the peaks of Mauna Kea.

As fire met snow, the earth hissed and steamed. Poliʻahu’s golden robe caught fire as she passed through a wall of flames. She threw it off and stood tall, glowing in a dazzling white robe.

Pele summoned a river of lava to chase her, riding its red-hot crest like a wave. But Poliʻahu didn’t flinch. She stood in its path, arms wide. Icy wind and snow rushed down the mountain. The lava slowed... then split apart at her feet, moving around her like water around a stone.

When the lava reached the ocean, it formed a long flat point of land known to this day as Laupahoehoe, and the great ledge of the arch of Onomea. The arch collapsed during an earthquake in 1956.

After that day, Pele never dared to cross Mauna Kea again. The snowy north remained Poliʻahu’s peaceful home, and the fiery south belonged to Pele.
