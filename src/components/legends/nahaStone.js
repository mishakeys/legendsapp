`In ancient Hawai ªi, the Naha Stone was a sacred symbol used to test royal lineage and strength. 

Infants of Naha descent were placed on the stone; those who remained silent were destined for leadership. 

A prophecy foretold that whoever could overturn the massive stone would unite the Hawaiian Islands.

Though not of Naha blood, the young Kamehameha traveled to Hilo, welcomed by his chiefly aunt Ululani. 

After a grand feast, he declared his intent to overturn the Naha Stone. The next morning, accompanied by Ululani, her son Keaweokahikikona, 

and a procession of chiefs and commoners, Kamehameha faced the stone. With supernatural strength, he overturned it, fulfilling the ancient prophecy.

News of his feat spread quickly, inspiring the people and marking Kamehameha as the destined leader who would go on to unify the islands. 

Today, the Naha Stone rests in front of the Hilo Public Library, a powerful symbol of strength, prophecy, and the birth of a nation.`
