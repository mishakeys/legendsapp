`High above Rainbow Falls lived Mo‘o Kuna, a powerful dragon with a slippery lizard’s body and a fearsome appearance. 

Mo‘o Kuna often tormented the goddess Hina, who made her home in the cave behind the falls. Drawn by her beauty, 

he would slither down the river to see her, but Hina wanted nothing to do with him. Angered by her rejection, 

Mo‘o Kuna lashed the river with his tail, sending torrents of water and rolling logs and boulders to disturb her peace.

Hina’s cave was strong, and she had her son Maui, whose great strength protected her. Knowing this, Mo‘o Kuna stayed away when Maui was near.

But one day, when Maui went fishing far out at sea, Mo‘o Kuna saw his chance. He hurled a massive boulder into the river below the falls, 

blocking the water’s flow. The river rose higher and higher, flooding Hina’s cave. In desperation, Hina cried out for help. Her voice rose to 

the heavens, reaching Maui across the ocean. Maui saw the cloud he had placed to watch over his mother lifting higher and higher as a sign she was in danger.

With one mighty stroke of his magic paddle, Maui flew across the sea to the mouth of the Wailuku River. 

Grabbing the magic club he had once used to tame the sun, he raced upriver. Seeing the great boulder blocking the water, 

Maui struck it with a single powerful blow, splitting it in two. The river rushed free once more.

Hearing the crash and seeing his plan fail, Mo‘o Kuna fled up the river, disappearing into a dark cave, trembling at the thought of capture by Maui.

When Maui saw that Hina was safe, he snatched up his magic spear and ran after the Mo‘o. He hurled his spear into the blackness of the cave. 

It thudded into the lava wall, and while Maui struggled to free it, the dragon slipped away, fleeing farther upstream.
