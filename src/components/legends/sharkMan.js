`In the lush valley of Waipiʻo lived a woman named Kalei, famed for her beauty, strength, and skill in swimming and diving. 

One day, while bathing, she caught the eye of Kamohoaliʻi, the great shark god, disguised as a handsome man. He won her heart and married her.

Soon after, Kalei became pregnant. One night, Kamohoaliʻi revealed his true nature, warning her that their child would have a dual nature — human and shark — and 

commanded her never to feed him animal flesh. Then Kamohoaliʻi returned to the sea.

When the boy was born, he was strong and handsome like any other child, except for a shark’s mouth between his shoulder blades. 

Fearing the jealousy of the Chiefs and King, Kalei and her family vowed to keep his secret. His mother made him wear a kapa cloak at all times.

However, the boy’s grandfather ignored the divine warning and fed Nanaue dog meat and pork, hoping to strengthen him. As Nanaue grew, 

his appetite for flesh became insatiable. Though athletic and handsome, he avoided games and gatherings, always cloaked to hide his back.

In time, villagers began to vanish. Nanaue, often seen working in his mother’s taro patch, had a habit of warning travelers, "Take care, or you may disappear." 

Those who met him were often never seen again.

The King ordered all the men of Waipiʻo Valley to work the fields of a great plantation. But Nanaue stayed behind, 

drawing attention and suspicion. When questioned, he claimed he didn’t know the work was required. He was soon summoned to join the others. 

While working, curious young men pulled away his cloak, revealing the terrible shark mouth. Enraged, Nanaue bit several of them before fleeing.

The people demanded Kalei and her family be punished, but the King, cautious of offending the shark god, refused. 

Instead, he ordered offerings to Kamohoaliʻi, who responded through a chant. Grieving, he blamed the grandfather’s disobedience but spared Nanaue, 

declaring that Nanaue must leave Hawai‘i forever or be killed by his shark soldiers if he returned.

Nanaue left Hawai‘i for Maui, but could not resist his nature. Eventually, on Kaua‘i, 

he resumed his old ways, was captured, and killed — ending the legacy of the shark-man.`
